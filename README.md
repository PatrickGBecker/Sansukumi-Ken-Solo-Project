# SANSUKUMI-KEN || rock-paper-scissors

### Project Specifications
- Project specs can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/rock-paper-scissors-solo.html).

### Learning Goals
Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
- DRY JavaScript
- Event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge

### Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

### Features
- The user can select between two different game modes.
- When hovering above each game mode, the rules will display.
- Each mode has a variation of signs the user can choose from.
- After a selection has been made the user will initiate a game of rock, paper, scissors with the computer.
- The winner will be displayed, the score will be updated, and the game will reset for another round.

### Challenges
- The first challenge was figuring out how to, where to, and what to test in order to trace the logic that I had built.
- Understanding the interaction between classes and their parameters when building the logic for changing screens.

### Wins
- I still feel strong with the html and css.  I also like interacting with the DOM via query selectors and event listeners. I like that there is a general set path of logic to follow so it was easier for me to pick up on this concept.
